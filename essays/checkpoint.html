<h2>Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details</h2>
<p>Assignment 2 was an extension of assignment 1, which included the addition of several different features including a login and registration page. These included adding additional HTML pages and also creating additional server posts to verify information. <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2_retrospective.html">https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2_retrospective.html</a></p>

<h2>What did you learn from this assignment?</h2>
<p>I felt as if I didn't necessarily learn much information when doing assignment 2. It was more of a reinforcement of the concepts in assignment 1 for me. Since we already went through different verifications and redirections through a server involving post and get requests, assignment 2 was more repitition than anything. One thing I probably learned was to carry a query string over to the invoice page through the login or registration.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I did not work with a partner. I think that having one would have been beneficial at some points in time but I didn't seek one out.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?</h2>
<p>When I needed help on certain tasks, I asked for help from previous ITM 352 students. It was mainly just figuring out how to pass the query string through multiple pages. They were able to help me understand how to obtain the querystring into a variable and then refer to it later when redirecting and add it to the future querystring in the invoice page.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?</h2>
<p>This assignment really deferred in terms of the amount of code necessary to make it work. Although there was a lot of repition of assignment 1 such as the basic concepts of validation and redirecting, there were many different variations of validations that we had to use. An example of these are the username and password errors. Aside from that, there was a little more logical structuring that needed to be figured out before I started.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</h2>
<p>If I were to estimate, I used 25% of my time thinking about how to do things, 45% writing code without testing, and 30% testing and debugging.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?</h2>
<p>Testing a lot while I made progress really helped during this assignment 2 process. There were so many different validations and testing helped to ensure I wasn't typing code that wasn't working for no reason and running in circles. Something that didn't work well was looking at other people's code for a quick and easy solution. I found that this was not beneficial because everyone has different ways that they used variables and whatnot in order to get their end product. Looking at what they typed while not understanding was a huge mistake that confused me even further.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?</h2>
<p>If I could go back in time I would start assignment 2 earlier. I feel as if I could have created a better end product if I really worked through it early. However, I procrastinated and kind of rushed my result. Therefore, I wasn't able to keep my code organized and commented as well as I would've liked to. For assignment 3, I will definitely try to start early instead of later and just do it incrementaly.</p>
