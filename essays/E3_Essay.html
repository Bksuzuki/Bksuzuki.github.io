<h2> BrowserHsitory6 </h2>
<p> Browser History 6 was actually quite fun for me. Although I wasn't able to complete the WOD on my first try, seeing the end product was pretty fulfilling. However, there was a lot of changes to make including adding the different HTML files. I believe on the first try, I got stuck when adding the different buttons and my images weren't displaying after the mouse over. After watching the screencast, it clarified how to use those specific functions so I was able to do it by the third try. </p>

<h2> SmartPhoneProducts1 With Variables </h2>
<p> Fo SmartPhoneProducts1 with variables, it was a pretty straightforward process for me. I had to do two attempts because the first one I kind of went in blind. I then watched the screencast and realized some of the minor mistakes I made with sourcing from the different file and whatnot. However, I was able to finish it in the Rx time on my second try since it was more of a repetative process than many different tasks. </p>

<h2> Invoice 1 </h2>
<p> Despite Invoice1 being quite difficult for me my first two tries, I really enjoyed doing it. I could definitely see the process of the different functions and using variables within these functions. The main thing I had trouble with was making it display on a table. After watching the screencast on the second try, I was able to copy and paste the code from the browser and use it to format the table, which made it a lot easier.</p>

<h2> Invoice 2 </h2>
<p> Invoice 2 was also quite fun for me because I really understood what the objective of the WOD was and how I could achieve it. My first attempt I got stuck trying to fix the decimal points. After watching the screencast for that specific product, I was able to figure things out and Invoice 2 was pretty smooth sailing after that. </p>

<h2> SmartPhoneProducts 2 </h2>
<p> I had a rough time with SmartPhoneProducts2. For some reason my formatting of the pictures kept getting affected, which was confusing because I felt like I didn't do anything to change it. I also kept getting errors about the server having issues and my code had nothing to do with that. I should have done the WOD earlier and asked the professor for help because in the end I wasn't able to get it completely working and submitted it with some errors. </p>

<h2>  Summary </h2>
<p> All together, these WODs definitely worked towards building a functional web store. I was able to learn how to make a dynamic web page and how to really get rid of certain hard coding. In addition, organization was also another topic that I believe was covered in terms of sourcing from other files and adding comments to identify code blocks. Overall, these WODs definitely have a clear end goal that will be nice to see put together. </p>

<h2>  Ways I Can Improve </h2>
<p> I thought that there were definitely a lot of ways that I could have improved when doing these WODs. I don't have a single one that took only one try and I think I should be able to logically think them through and achieve that. Therefore, I need to familiarize myself more with the different subjects and really know how to use them before attempting the WOD. On top of that, I need to get them started earlier, specifically because I couldn't get SmartPhoneProducts 2 to work as there were some issues with the server. By doing this I think I can really benefit as I identify my mistakes and correct them.</p>
