  <h2>My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:</h2>
<p>Thus far, I believe that my programming has improved a lot in terms of the general understanding of coding logic. Specifically, I refer to how different files, functions, objects, etc work together in order to culminate towards an end goal. During the labs, I didn't really have too much understanding of how things would be applicable to real scenarios. However, after working on Assignment 1, I definitely have had sort of an enlightening snap of understanding for algorithmic thinking. In addition, server side processing was a super difficult task for me and working with Assignment 1 really forced me to further my understanding of this specific topic. Lastly, I have begun to test my code out a lot more than I used to. It has helped me in so many ways to actually continuosly check if what I'm coding is working the way I want it to. Hopefully I keep this habit and use it in the future.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:</h2>
<p>Personally, I honestly need a refresher on the basics. Since there's been so much content that we've learned and it continuously gets more and more complex, I feel as if I've neglected the basics of coding, which we learned a little while ago, such as CSS and HTML formatting. There is so much that I need to brush up on and if so, I feel as if working on the assignments would get a lot easier. Going forwards, I think watching the screencasts one more time would be a good idea so I can really see the alternative pathways that I can take in order to get things done.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:</h2>
<p>I think that for certain WODs such ones that require server side processing, I would need a screencast to show me the general direction as to where to start. I have a hard time remembering syntax as well but if I refresh the content before taking the WODs it helps a lot. Therefore, in regards to if I've learned a lot from the WODs, my answer would most definitely be yes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:</h2>
<p>The labs are definitely hard for me due to the fact that there is always some content that requires more deep thinking than what the screencasts provide. However, this can be a good thing because it does help you learn and really understand the content. That being said, I am not always confident on the labs but hope to always gain understanding by struggling through them and interpreting the questions and directions in my own way.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:</h2>
<p>Assignment 1 has really helped my so far in terms of my understanding with programming. Although it is so frustrating working through it, when I have breakthroughs, it is so satisfying and also educational. I really don't feel ready to work on Assignment 2 because of what it is asking for. I will definitely need help getting the assignment to where I want it to be but int he end, I will probably learn a lot as I did with Assignment 1.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:</h2>
<p>I think one way that the class can be improved is to make the labs shorter and give a sample file that all students can start with. This way, when students fall behind in certain labs(as I did) or even jsut do things differently that may make it difficult for future labs, it is easier for them to get back on track.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):</h2>
<p>The readings from sources like W3 skills have really helped due to the fact that they give specific examples of how certain things affect the overall outcome. In addition, one on one help with Professor Port has actually helped so much when working on Assignment 1. Researching online can only go so far when your code is really complex and different than what the internet would assume. With Professor Port looking at my code, it has helped me understand the errors in my code and hopefully ensure I don't make the same mistakes.</p>
