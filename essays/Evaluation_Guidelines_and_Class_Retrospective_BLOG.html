<h2>Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)</h2>
<p>My website, The Countdown, is an online ecommerce website that sells, watches, suits, and glasses. It originally started with just watches and carried onto suits and glasses because I liked the kind of higher end feel.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2>Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</h2>
<p>I definitely did have shortcomings. I didn't get my individual requirement done, which was the rating system. This was because I kept running into errors when trying to pass the ratings to the product information. In addition, I also didn't get the mailing system to work because the nodemailer module for some reason could not be found. I thiink if I had been in class, I would've been able to complete this with the class so it was unfortunate that I was sick. Another feature that I couldn't get working was the delete items in cart portion. However, you can edit that on the product pages.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2>Describe what you are most proud of about your system:</h2>
<p>Although the delete protion does not work, I'm probably most proud of the cart. It took me so long to figure out how to display the cart and also invoice because I kept trying to make a convenient code block that would gather the information from all three arrays. However, in the end, I just ended up creating three code blocks in one table for the three kinds of products. This took very long to realize that I should just brute force it.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2>Describe what you are least happy with your system:</h2>
<p>I'm least happy with the overall design. CSS was always the last thing on my mind because I wanted the website to work rather than looking good and adding extra things to beautify my website. I would definitely look into creating a more eye friendly website one day. In addition, I hate that the delete button does not work. I tried hard to get that to work but the undefined error kept on coming up.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?</h2>
<p>For assignment 2, there was a lot of code that I figured out on my own. In other words, I used syntax and functions that I personally made and understood. However, in Assignment 3, there were things such as nodemailer and the loadJSON function that I didn't understand but had to use. It got a little comlicated and I was definitely more confused. In addition, I had to rewrite so much stuff that the server.js file became pretty unorganized.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2>When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?</h2>
<p>I struggled with a lot of problems for assignment 3. Errors constantly occured and things that were figured out in assignment 2 no longer worked. For the problems that I fixed, I just went line by line and tested for errors and tried to figure things out. Lots of mistakes were just small things and also mistakes in the order of things.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2>Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?</h2>
<p>What worked well for me was actually looking at other code and trying to understand it. Although this took up a lot of time and I wasn't necessarily able to implement all of it, everytime that I gained understanding, I enjoyed and was able to use it.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2>Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?</h2>
<p>There was a lot of code in the examples that I tried to use but it didn't end up fitting with my assignemnt. I think really understanding the code and making up my own code blocks turned out to be more productive rather than attempting to copy and piece together an assignment.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2>What did you learn from doing this assignment?</h2>
<p>I learned a lot about sessions and how helpful they are. Beforehand, it was required to pass all the information through the parameters but using the loadJSON function and the sessions was quite enlightening.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?</h2>
<p>I would definitely just spend more time on my individual requirement. I was having such difficulty converting the stars selected into quantities and sending them to the JSON file so I eventually gave up and focused on the other aspects of the website.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</h2>
<p>I probably spent 50% of the time thinking about how to do something, 20% of the time writing code, and 30% of the time testing and debugging since I had so many errors.
<p><br></p>

<h2>Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)</h2>
<p>I personally worked alone.</p>
<p><br></p>
